		<h2>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h2>
		Grind Insector’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Grind Insector can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
		<br><br>
		We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
		<br><br>
		We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Grind Insector’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Your Content in our Services</h2>
		Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
		<br><br>
		When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Grind Insector (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.
		<br><br>
		Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
		<br><br>
		If you have a Grind Insector Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Grind Insector or on third-party applications connected to your Grind Insector Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Grind Insector Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.
		<br><br>
		You can find more information about how Grind Insector uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
		<br><br>
		<h2>About Software in our Services</h2>
		When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.
		<br><br>
		Grind Insector gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Grind Insector as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Grind Insector, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.
		<br><br>
		Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.
		<br><br>
		Modifying and Terminating our Services
		We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
		<br><br>
		You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Grind Insector may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.
		<br><br>
		We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
		We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
		<br><br>
		Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Grind Insector nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.
		<br><br>
		Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Liability for our Services</h2>
		When permitted by law, Grind Insector, and Grind Insector’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
		<br><br>
		To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Grind Insector, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).
		<br><br>
		In all cases, Grind Insector, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
		<br><br>
		We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.
		<br><br>
		<h2>Business uses of our Services</h2>
		If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Grind Insector and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.
		<br><br>
		<h2>About these Terms</h2>
		We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
		<br><br>
		If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
		<br><br>
		These terms control the relationship between Grind Insector and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
		<br><br>
		If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
		<br><br>
		If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
		<br><br>
		The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Grind Insector consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
